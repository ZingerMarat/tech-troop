    <h1>My Personal Introduction</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Marat Zinger</strong>, and I'm a <em>passionate learner</em> exploring the world of web development.</p>
    <p>I have a strong curiosity for how things work under the hood, especially when it comes to technology.</p>
    <p>
      This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering, where I discovered my enthusiasm for building user-centered applications that solve real-world problems. I enjoy combining logic with creativity, and that’s what makes
      programming so exciting for me.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of development, I’m a person with diverse interests that keep me inspired. I enjoy <strong>coding not just as a job</strong>, but as <strong> away to express ideas</strong> and build tools that <em>people find useful</em>. In my free
      time, I love diving into science fiction novels, going for long nature walks, and even experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. These activities help me <me>stay balanced and bring a fresh perspective to the problems</me> I work on. I'm
      also passionate about <strong>sustainable technology</strong> and how we, as developers, can contribute to a more efficient and eco-friendly future.
    </p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My biggest goal is to become a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> capable of creating powerful, responsive, and accessible web applications. I’m especially interested in working on projects that have
      <em>a positive impact—be it in education, mental health, or environmental sustainability</em>. In the short term, I aim to strengthen my knowledge of <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, expand my portfolio with meaningful projects, and
      actively contribute to open-source communities. Long-term, I hope to work in an innovative team or even start my own venture that focuses on creating tools <em>to improve lives through technology</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Short-term Goals</h3>
